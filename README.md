# IDEA and Origin
In the plastic injection molding industry, valve gates are sometimes used to control the flow of material through an injection nozzle. The same concept could be applied to 3D printing nozzles. Long heat zones in fast FDM printing, as well as nozzles with wide diameters, are prone to oozing. Retraction, where the filament is pulled back, is commonly used to mitigate this issue, but it is often not sufficient.

# Possible Solutions
The idea is to stop the flow by blocking the nozzle. In injection molding, a round pin is often pushed into the nozzle to close it. 

The main problem for 3D printing is that in most hotend designs, the filament follows a straight path, which would be blocked by this pin.

1. The pin could be inserted at an angle to keep the filament path straight.
2. Instead of pushing and pulling the pin, a twisting motion could be used to open and close the nozzle. A special pin geometry would be needed.
